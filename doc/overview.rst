Overview
========

Democratic, hassle free collaborative management of any sized group for teams, clubs, organizations, governments, worlds, solar systems, galaxies...

If only there was an easy way to
  - See all of our legislation/documentation
  - see all proposed changes
  - vote on any changes that interest us
  - delegate my vote to people I trust (and get my vote back whenever I want)


When the going's good, I don't have to do anything. If I have an issue I can easily raise it. If I want to vote on anything in particular, I can.
