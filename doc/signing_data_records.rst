Signing Data Records
====================

Using digital signatures, both the attendee and the range officer can sign the range register entry detailing the attendee's visit, thus authenticating it. The actual signing can be done by the application.

A digital signature is a sequence of characters generated by taking the content of a message (which can be a range register data row) and a user's private key (which only they possess and which is encrypted on their local device (and any desired backups) with a passphrase).

Any user may also use their private key to generate a public key which can be handed out to those needing to verify the user's signature. Other trusted users may sign the user's public key to certify that the user is trusted (e.g. they are an RO and/or a member of the club).

The public key may be used along with the message to verify that the user signed that exact message. This process may be automated.

Using digital signatures, anyone can authenticate the signatures of COB's members and ROs and verify that those signatures are genuine.

As only public keys are used for signature validation and verification, the password protected private keys never need to be communicated over a network, making this process considerably more secure than the paper alternative it aims to replace.

There are a number of open source digital signature applications that are trusted around the world. The most popular is `gpg <https://gnupg.org/>`_. This is available already bundled in a number of applications
