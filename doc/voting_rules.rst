Voting Rules
============

A .voting_rules file may be placed in each document folder.
The content of the .voting_rules affects patches relating to the folder's files and folders recursively.

The .voting_rules file is a part of the documentation and may be patched like any other file.

Voting rules may govern pattern specific determination of:

- The period from the last vote made after which the decision to accept or reject the patch will be made
- The voting criteria required to accept or reject a patch
- Merging criteria for the voting_rules
